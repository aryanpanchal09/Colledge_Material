Javascript Basics 

1. What is the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const` in JavaScript?
   `var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `const` cannot be reassigned, while `let` can.

2. What are closures in JavaScript?
   Closures occur when an inner function has access to variables from its outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.

3. Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.
   A promise represents an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

4. What is hoisting in JavaScript?
   Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations (but not initializations) to the top of their scope, allowing them to be used before they are declared.

5. What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
   `this` refers to the object in which a function is called. Its value depends on the context and the calling object.

6. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
   `==` compares values after type coercion, while `===` compares both value and type without type conversion.

7. Explain event delegation in JavaScript.
   Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events on its child elements.

8. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript?
   Synchronous code runs line by line, blocking further execution until the current task is completed. Asynchronous code allows tasks to run in the background.

9. What is the purpose of the `bind()` method in JavaScript?
   `bind()` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to a specific value, allowing for more control over `this` in callbacks.

10. What are arrow functions in JavaScript?
    Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for function expressions and do not bind their own `this`, using the surrounding scope instead.

11. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
    The event loop is responsible for executing asynchronous code by handling the callback queue and ensuring that tasks are executed in the proper order.

12. Explain the difference between `map()` and `forEach()` in JavaScript.
    `map()` returns a new array with the results of applying a function to each element, while `forEach()` simply iterates over the array without returning anything.

13. What is the `call()` method in JavaScript?
    `call()` invokes a function with a specified `this` context and arguments provided individually.

14. What are JavaScript promises and async/await?
    Promises handle asynchronous operations, while `async/await` provides syntactic sugar for working with promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.

15. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
    `null` is an assigned value representing "no value", while `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

16. Explain what a higher-order function is in JavaScript.
    A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

17. What is the purpose of the `reduce()` method in JavaScript?
    `reduce()` is used to apply a function to each array element, reducing the array to a single value (e.g., sum, product).

18. What is a callback function in JavaScript?
    A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed after a certain operation is completed.

19. What is JSON and how is it used in JavaScript?
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for data exchange. It is used to serialize objects into strings and parse strings into objects.

20. What is the purpose of `Array.prototype.filter()` in JavaScript?
    `filter()` creates a new array with all elements that pass a specified test (provided as a callback function).

21. Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions.
    Function declarations are hoisted and can be called before they are defined, while function expressions are not hoisted.

22. What is debouncing in JavaScript?
    Debouncing is a technique to ensure that a function is not invoked too frequently, by delaying its execution until a specified time has passed since the last call.

23. What is the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?
    `typeof` is used to check the data type of a variable. For example, `typeof 42` returns `"number"`.

24. What are JavaScript template literals?
    Template literals are enclosed in backticks and allow embedded expressions using `${}`. They make it easier to construct strings with dynamic content.

25. What is the `spread` operator in JavaScript?
    The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded into individual elements where multiple values are expected.

26. What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()` in JavaScript?
    `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `splice()` modifies the array by adding/removing elements.

27. What is destructuring in JavaScript?
    Destructuring is a syntax for unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

28. What is the purpose of the `finally()` method in promises?
    `finally()` is called after a promise is settled (either resolved or rejected) and allows you to execute code regardless of the outcome.

29. What is `NaN` in JavaScript?
    `NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number" and indicates a result that is not a valid number, such as dividing a string by a number.

30. Explain how the `setTimeout()` function works in JavaScript.
    `setTimeout()` sets a timer that executes a callback function after a specified delay in milliseconds.

31. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in JavaScript?
    A shallow copy copies references to nested objects, while a deep copy creates completely independent copies of all objects.

32. What is event bubbling in JavaScript?
    Event bubbling is when an event starts from the target element and propagates upward to its ancestors in the DOM.

33. What is the purpose of `Object.freeze()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.freeze()` makes an object immutable, preventing modification of existing properties or adding new properties.

34. Explain the `async` and `await` keywords in JavaScript.
    `async` functions return promises, while `await` pauses execution until the promise resolves, allowing asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style.

35. What is a `Proxy` in JavaScript?
    A `Proxy` is an object that wraps another object and intercepts operations like reading or writing properties, allowing custom behavior.

36. What is functional programming in JavaScript?
    Functional programming is a paradigm that treats functions as first-class citizens, avoids side effects, and emphasizes immutability.

37. What are modules in JavaScript and how are they used?
    JavaScript modules allow code to be split into reusable files that can be imported and exported between scripts, improving code organization.

38. What is the difference between `window` and `document` in JavaScript?
    `window` represents the browser window object, while `document` represents the DOM (Document Object Model) of the current web page.

39. What is the purpose of the `instanceof` operator?
    `instanceof` checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor, returning `true` or `false`.

40. What is the purpose of `Object.assign()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.assign()` copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object, allowing for object cloning and merging.

41. What is the difference between `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()`?
    `Object.keys()` returns an array of a given object's property names, while `Object.values()` returns an array of the corresponding property values.

42. What is the difference between `for...of` and `for...in` loops in JavaScript?
    `for...of` iterates over iterable objects like arrays, while `for...in` iterates over enumerable properties of an object.

43. What is a promise chain in JavaScript?
    A promise chain is created by chaining `.then()` methods together to execute multiple asynchronous operations in sequence.

44. What are default parameters in JavaScript?
    Default parameters allow function parameters to have default values if no argument is passed, simplifying function calls.

45. What is a generator function in JavaScript?
    A generator function uses `function` syntax and can pause execution using the `yield` keyword, resuming later with `.next()`.

46. What is the `localStorage` object in JavaScript?
    `localStorage` allows the storage of key-value pairs in the browser that persist even after the page is closed, unlike `sessionStorage`.

47. What is a polyfill in JavaScript?
    A polyfill is a piece of code that provides modern functionality on older browsers that do not support it natively.

48. What is the difference between `apply()` and `call()` in JavaScript?
    Both invoke functions with a specified `this` context, but `apply()` takes an array of arguments, while `call()`

 takes individual arguments.

49. What is the difference between `innerHTML` and `textContent`?
    `innerHTML` returns the HTML content of an element, while `textContent` returns only the text, ignoring HTML tags.

50. What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?
    An IIFE is a function that is defined and immediately invoked, often used to create a local scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.

------

1. What is `Object.create()` in JavaScript?
   `Object.create()` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. It’s a way to set up prototype inheritance.

2. What is currying in JavaScript?
   Currying is a technique where a function takes multiple arguments one at a time. Each function call returns another function until all arguments are provided.

3. What is `strict mode` in JavaScript?
   Strict mode enables a stricter parsing and error handling in your JavaScript code, catching common coding mistakes like undeclared variables.

4. What is the purpose of the `export` and `import` keywords in JavaScript?
   `export` and `import` are used in JavaScript ES6 modules to share and load functionality across different files.

5. What is the purpose of the `setInterval()` function?
   `setInterval()` repeatedly calls a function with a fixed time delay in milliseconds. It continues calling the function until cleared.

6. What is tail call optimization in JavaScript?
   Tail call optimization is a memory-saving technique where the last function call in a function doesn’t add a new frame to the call stack.

7. What is the `Promise.all()` method in JavaScript?
   `Promise.all()` takes an array of promises and resolves when all of them are resolved, or rejects if any of them fail.

8. What is an `async generator` in JavaScript?
   An async generator allows functions to yield multiple values over time, returning promises with `await` to handle asynchronous operations.

9. What is an `observable` in JavaScript?
   An observable represents a stream of events over time, where data is emitted asynchronously, and observers subscribe to it to receive updates.

10. What is the `Intl` object in JavaScript?
    The `Intl` object is used for internationalization, providing language-sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date/time formatting.

11. What is the difference between `encodeURIComponent()` and `encodeURI()`?
    `encodeURI()` escapes characters necessary for a URI, while `encodeURIComponent()` escapes all special characters, making it suitable for individual query parameters.

12. What is the `fetch()` API in JavaScript?
    `fetch()` is a modern JavaScript API used to make network requests, returning a promise that resolves with the `Response` object.

13. What is object destructuring in JavaScript?
    Object destructuring allows you to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables in a single statement.

14. What is the `DocumentFragment` in JavaScript?
    A `DocumentFragment` is a minimal DOM-like object that can hold nodes temporarily, allowing you to manipulate a group of elements before appending them to the DOM.

15. What is the purpose of `Promise.race()` in JavaScript?
    `Promise.race()` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects.

16. What is the `typeof null` in JavaScript and why?
    `typeof null` returns `"object"` because of a bug in JavaScript’s early implementation, though null is technically a primitive value.

17. What are service workers in JavaScript?
    Service workers are scripts that run in the background, allowing features like offline support, background sync, and push notifications for web apps.

18. What is a WeakMap in JavaScript?
    A `WeakMap` is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys must be objects and are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage-collected.

19. What are regular expressions in JavaScript?
    Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They can be used for searching, replacing, or validating data.

20. What is a factory function in JavaScript?
    A factory function is a function that returns a new object every time it's called, allowing you to create multiple instances of an object.

21. What is `Object.entries()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.entries()` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property key-value pairs, useful for iterating over object properties.

22. What is `Object.fromEntries()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.fromEntries()` transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object, reversing the effect of `Object.entries()`.

23. What is an `iterator` in JavaScript?
    An iterator is an object that defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its completion using the `next()` method.

24. What is a `symbol` in JavaScript?
    A `symbol` is a primitive data type that provides a unique identifier, useful for adding hidden object properties that won’t collide with other property keys.

25. What is `eval()` in JavaScript and why should it be avoided?
    `eval()` executes a string of JavaScript code. It is generally avoided due to security and performance concerns, as it can execute malicious code.

26. What is `new.target` in JavaScript?
    `new.target` lets you detect whether a function or constructor was called using the `new` keyword, preventing misuse of constructors as regular functions.

27. What is the difference between `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()`?
    `Object.seal()` prevents new properties from being added or removed, while `Object.freeze()` also prevents changes to existing properties' values.

28. What is a promise constructor in JavaScript?
    A promise constructor is a function passed to `new Promise()`. It takes two arguments, `resolve` and `reject`, used to control the outcome of the promise.

29. What is `Function.prototype.apply()` in JavaScript?
    `apply()` is similar to `call()` but takes an array of arguments. It allows you to call a function with a specific `this` and arguments provided in an array.

30. What is the difference between `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`?
    `Math.random()` generates a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

31. What is the difference between `innerWidth` and `clientWidth` in JavaScript?
    `innerWidth` returns the width of the browser window, including scrollbars. `clientWidth` returns the width of an element excluding borders and scrollbars.

32. What is the `history` object in JavaScript?
    The `history` object allows manipulation of the browser session history, enabling navigation through the user's past browsing actions.

33. What is a Proxy trap in JavaScript?
    A Proxy trap intercepts operations on an object, such as property access, assignment, or method invocation, enabling custom behavior through a handler.

34. What is `Object.defineProperty()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.defineProperty()` defines a new property directly on an object or modifies an existing one, allowing fine-grained control over its behavior (e.g., writable, configurable).

35. What is `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` returns a property descriptor for an object’s own property, describing attributes like `value`, `writable`, `enumerable`, and `configurable`.

36. What is an accessor property in JavaScript?
    Accessor properties are properties defined by getter and setter functions, allowing custom logic when retrieving or setting a value.

37. What are weak references in JavaScript?
    Weak references, like those in `WeakMap`, allow an object to be garbage-collected if there are no strong references to it, preventing memory leaks.

38. What is `Array.prototype.every()` in JavaScript?
    `every()` checks if all elements in an array satisfy a given condition (predicate). It returns `true` if all elements pass the test, otherwise `false`.

39. What is the difference between `addEventListener()` and `onclick`?
    `addEventListener()` allows multiple event listeners on an element, while `onclick` can only have one handler per element.

40. What is `sessionStorage` in JavaScript?
    `sessionStorage` is similar to `localStorage` but persists data only for the duration of the page session, which ends when the browser or tab is closed.

41. What is method chaining in JavaScript?
    Method chaining is a programming pattern where multiple methods are called on the same object consecutively, returning the object after each method.

42. What is `Object.is()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.is()` compares two values for equality, similar to `===`, but it also handles special cases like comparing `NaN` to `NaN` (which returns `true`).

43. What is `setImmediate()` in JavaScript?
    `setImmediate()` executes a function as soon as the current event loop completes, but before any I/O events or timers. It’s not part of standard JavaScript but is available in Node.js.

44. What is throttling in JavaScript?
    Throttling limits the number of times a function can be called over a period. It ensures that a function is called no more than once every specified interval.

45. What is `requestAnimationFrame()` in JavaScript?
    `requestAnimationFrame()` tells the browser to execute a function before the next repaint, used to optimize animations for smoother performance.

46. What is shadow DOM in JavaScript?
    Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows encapsulation of the DOM and CSS within a

 component, preventing styles from leaking into or out of the component.

47. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous exceptions in JavaScript?
    Synchronous exceptions are thrown during code execution, while asynchronous exceptions, such as promise rejections, occur after code execution completes.

48. What is `Reflect` in JavaScript?
    The `Reflect` object provides methods to intercept JavaScript operations, complementing Proxy by allowing reflective operations like `Reflect.get()` or `Reflect.apply()`.

49. What is `Object.getPrototypeOf()` in JavaScript?
    `Object.getPrototypeOf()` returns the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]`) of a given object, providing insight into the object’s inheritance chain.

50. What is a module pattern in JavaScript?
    The module pattern encapsulates code in an IIFE or an ES6 module, allowing you to create private variables and methods while exposing only what’s needed.
