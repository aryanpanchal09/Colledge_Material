React Js Basics

 Core React Concepts

1. JSX: Explain the role of JSX in React development.
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures directly in your JavaScript code.

2. Components: What are components in React, and how do they differ from functions?
    Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be either class-based or functional components, but both serve the same purpose of encapsulating UI logic.

3. State and Props: Differentiate between state and props in React components.
    State is used to store data that can change over time within a component. Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.

4. Lifecycle Methods: Name and explain the purpose of the key lifecycle methods in React.
    `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount` are some of the key lifecycle methods used for various tasks like fetching data, updating the DOM, and cleaning up resources.

5. Virtual DOM: Describe the concept of the Virtual DOM in React.
    The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to efficiently update the UI by comparing the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and only updating the necessary parts.

 React Hooks

6. useState Hook: How does the `useState` hook work, and what is its purpose?
    `useState` is used to manage state within functional components. It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function to update it.

7. useEffect Hook: Explain the useEffect hook and its different usage scenarios.
    `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or cleaning up resources. It can be used with dependencies to control when it runs.

8. useContext Hook: Describe the useContext hook and its use in sharing data across components.
    `useContext` is used to access values from a context object. It provides a way to share data without explicitly passing props down through the component tree.

9. useReducer Hook: When is the useReducer hook preferred over useState, and why?
    `useReducer` is preferred when you need to manage complex state logic, especially when the state updates can be derived from previous state and actions. It provides a more structured way to manage state.

10. useRef Hook: What is the useRef hook used for, and in what scenarios is it beneficial?
    `useRef` is used to create references to DOM elements or values that persist between renders. It can be useful for accessing DOM elements directly or for storing values that don't need to trigger re-renders.

 React Performance Optimization

11. Memoization: Explain the concept of memoization in React and how it can improve performance.
    Memoization is a technique that caches the result of a function call based on its arguments. In React, it can be used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components if their props haven't changed.

12. ShouldComponentUpdate: How can the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method be used to optimize performance?
    `shouldComponentUpdate` allows you to control whether a component should re-render based on changes to its props or state. By returning `false`, you can prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving performance.

13. Key Props: Explain the importance of the `key` prop in React lists and how it helps with efficient updates.
    The `key` prop is used to identify unique items in a list. React uses it to efficiently update the list by matching items based on their keys.

14. Lazy Loading: Describe the concept of lazy loading in React and its benefits.
    Lazy loading is a technique that delays the loading of components until they are actually needed. This can improve initial load times and overall performance, especially for large applications.

15. Code Splitting: How can code splitting be implemented in React to optimize performance?
    Code splitting involves breaking down your application's code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. This can improve initial load times and reduce the overall bundle size.

 React Routing

16. React Router: What is React Router, and what are its core components?
    React Router is a popular library for managing navigation in React applications. Its core components include `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Route>`, `<Switch>`, and `<Link>`.

17. Nested Routes: Explain how nested routes are used to create more complex routing structures.
    Nested routes allow you to create hierarchical routing structures, where one route can have child routes. This is useful for creating more complex applications with multiple levels of navigation.

18. Programmatic Navigation: How can you navigate to different routes programmatically in React?
    You can use the `history` object provided by React Router to navigate to different routes programmatically. This is often used for handling user interactions or redirects.

19. Route Parameters: How are route parameters used to pass data to components?
    Route parameters are placeholders in the URL that can be used to pass dynamic data to components. This is useful for creating dynamic pages based on user input.

20. Route Guards: Explain the concept of route guards and how they can be used to protect routes.
    Route guards are functions that can be used to control access to routes based on certain conditions. They can be used to implement authentication or authorization logic.
